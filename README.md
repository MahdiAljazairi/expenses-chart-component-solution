## My process

### What I learned

I'm now comfortable with working with `XMLHttpRequest` objects. Although I would prefer loading all the necessary data via the server itself instead.

Also, using Sass for this project was a perfect decision, and nesting saved me a lot of headache. You can look up and compare "`main.scss`" and "`style.css`" to see the difference yourself. Especially rules nested inside `#chart`. I did make plenty of changes to those rules and switched their places a couple of times. Imagine doing all of this in pure CSS. What a pain!

### Continued development

I got to get a handle on Fetch API. Plus getting introduced to back-end stuff as well.

### Note

You might have noticed that I have a "`sass`" folder, inside of which sits a "`main.scss`" file. This is not a typo. The word **Sass** refers to the language at entirety. Sass was originally written in *Indented syntax*, and the extension for these files was "`*.sass`". It was later that they introduced the *Sassy CSS* syntax or *SCSS* whose extention was "`*.scss`".

So the "`sass`" folder is for all Sass files either written in Indented or SCSS syntax.

## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VSCode, but still my favorite.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
